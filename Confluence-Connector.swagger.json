Otherwise, if you are authenticating directly against the REST API, the REST API supports basic auth (see [Basic auth for REST APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/)).\n\n**Authorization:** If you are building a Cloud app, authorization can be implemented by [scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/scopes/) or by [OAuth 2.0 user impersonation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/oauth-2-jwt-bearer-tokens-for-apps). Otherwise, if you are making calls directly against the REST API, authorization is based on the user used in the authentication process.\n\nSee [Security overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/) for more details on authentication and authorization."

        "body": "**Pagination:** The Confluence REST API v2 uses cursor-based pagination: a method that returns a response with multiple objects can only return a limited number at one time. This limits the size of responses and conserves server resources.\n\nUse the 'limit' and 'cursor' parameters on endpoints that return multiple objects to work with pagination. First, make a request with your desired limit in the 'limit' parameter, then observe the `Link` header in the response. If there are additional entities to be retrieved, the `next` URL in the `Link` header will allow you to retrieve the next set of results. This relative URL will also be available under the `_links.next` property of paginated responses. \n\nFor example, the following request will return 5 page objects (if there are 5 present in the target site).\n```\nGET /wiki/api/v2/pages?limit=5\n```\n\nIf there are additional pages available, the `Link` header will look like:\n```\n</wiki/api/v2/pages?limit=5&cursor=<cursor token>>; rel=\"next\"\n```\nThe URL within the `Link` header will allow you to access the next 5 pages, while the `rel=\"next\"` denotes that the URL refers to the \"next\" set of pages. Relations for a single URL are separated by semicolons (;) and URLs are separated by commas (,)\nIf there are no related URLs, the `Link` header will not be present in the response and neither will the `next` property for `_links` in the response body."
